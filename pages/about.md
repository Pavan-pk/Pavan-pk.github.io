# **About Me**

Hello, This is **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am a seasoned software engineer with over 5 years of experience in building products which are consumed by millions of users. I am curiosity-driven, a self-starter, adept at learning new things, and have experience converting ideas into products. Further, I have earned MS with a specialization in AI. Currently, I am very passionate about applications of AI in planning and policy generation, and looking for opportunities to build and contribute to experiences that elevate my passion and have a positive impact all around.
